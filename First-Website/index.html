  <h2> My Dogs</h2>
  <section id="My Dogs">
    <h3> Desi</h3>
    <p>Desi is the first dog I have officially adoped. I have foster many dogs before but Desi is the first one I have taken full resposibility for. She is the sweetest most loving little pitbull in the world and I am so happy that she is mine. </p>

    <h3> Barrow</h3>
    <p> I adoped Barrow a year ago, right before the covid pandemic started. He is a senior dog, unlike Desi, so he mostly just wants to site around with me, which is so nice. I recently found out that he has cancer and will most likely only live another few months. I knew I wouldnt have him for a long time, but the news is still a blow to my heart. </p>
